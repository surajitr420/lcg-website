# Remodeling of LCG Polytechnic Website


The College Portal is a comprehensive online platform designed to provide students, faculty, and all the users with a single-point access to all college-related information and resources. This intuitive portal enables users to effortlessly navigate and access various features, including academic details, syllabus, faculty profiles, affiliation information, and more. With just a few clicks, users can explore college news, events, and updates, as well as utilize online services, making it an indispensable tool for the college community to stay informed, connected, and engaged.
In this project, we leveraged the powerful combination of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript to create a dynamic and responsive web application. Through this development process, we gained hands-on experience with HTML structures, CSS styling, Bootstrap frameworks, and JavaScript functionalities. We explored various elements of web development, including HTML tags, CSS selectors, Bootstrap components, and JavaScript methods, allowing us to craft a robust and user-friendly interface. This project solidified our understanding of front-end development concepts, enabling us to effectively integrate these technologies to deliver a seamless user experience.
